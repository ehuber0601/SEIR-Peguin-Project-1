## Introduction

For this project, I made a two player trivia game with questions that were about either geography or programming. If either player gets a question right, then he/she gets one point added to the score board.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- JQUERY

## Steps
- Created 20 questions on contentful.com
- Made an AJAX form containg all the questions and answers
- In my JS code, I pulled the AJAX and got the questions to display on the page.
- Then, I created functions to set the board and to add points to either player one or player 2 if they answered the question correctly.
- Lastly, I styled the page to give it more of a trivia game feel, such as adding a confetti background, and using a 3D font for the header that changes color every second!

## Challenges

#### I have trouble with 

Was a bit hard to come up with the right CSS styles for the game. Even more so for the media query part, because I wasn't exactly sure what to put for the min size. 
#### Example Table

| Column1 | Column2 |
|---------|---------|
| thing1 | thing2 |
| yadda1 | yadda2 |
